Esty Privacy Policy
Last updated: 5/21/2025

Overview
Esty is a documentation tool built for private caregivers and Direct Support Professionals (DSPs). We believe in ethical tech, full user control, and zero data exploitation. Esty is not a medical app, and it is not for use by government agencies or healthcare systems. You’re in control of your data at all times.

1. What We Collect
We only collect what you choose to enter:

Shift notes

Tags, tone, or support focus areas

We do not collect:

Legal names of clients

Health records or diagnoses

Location data or GPS

Contact info, photos, or files from your device

2. How We Store Your Data
All notes are saved to your secure Esty login. You can export or delete any content at any time.

Your data is:

Stored privately (linked only to your account)

Not shared with anyone else

Not used for training external models or analytics

3. What We Never Do
We never:

Sell your data

You own your content

You may download, delete, or clear your data anytime

We don’t keep backup copies unless you create them

6. Children’s Privacy
Esty is meant for caregivers—not children. You may document care for a child, but the app does not collect any child-identifiable info and does not offer child-facing features.

7. Policy Updates
If anything changes, we’ll update this policy and notify you directly in the app. You’ll always have full transparency and the ability to opt out or export/delete your content.
